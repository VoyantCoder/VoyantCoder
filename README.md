> I am Dashie and I love to code, but that is not all, I also love to write, read and overall live as fully as I can.  Therefore do I meditate everyday and simply work on myself, because I am myself as myself by myself.  That is how I was summoned into this place and that is how I will leave it, hence the mentality.
> 
> Among these repositories you will be able to find work I have put out.  Actual projects that I sat down for and smaller concepts I worked on through-out my programming journey.  Though my way of layout when it comes down to repositories is not approved by a ton of people, I do not really care.  It is my repository and therefore it should hold a part of me, if it were to be formed according to another their idea of 'proper' then it would be more so their repository.  
> 
> Regardless, feel free to surf around the repositories I present to you, I have organized them in the sense of a folder structure since that is literally the way they are present on my local system.  If you have any questions, suggestions or criticism -you can always reach out to me at KvinneKraft@protonmail.com.
