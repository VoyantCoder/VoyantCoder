**Hey there, I am Dashie and I am quite obsessed with the freedom of programming, on this platform I try to express my will to seek for which has yet to be found, in terms of source code.**

**I see my life like an application consisting of many classes.  Or perhaps more so an operating system which can run the application I wish to write.  Not just one application nor just one theme, but as many as my allocatable and accumulative capacity allows.**

> Programming allows you to be as free as you are willing to let yourself be.  This is exactly why I have been programming for over 10 years now.  I started with pen and paper and now, here I am with the latest tech available as of now.  I am a self taught programmer, but programming is one of my many aspects.  You know, you can program yourself.  You can integrate habits into your daily life by executing certain lines of code on your system.  Metaphorically speaking that is.

This is why programming is perfect to me, it allows you to draw the lines you wish to follow.  Code is a way of life, in the sense that the structural logicistic mechanisms within programming are applicable to real life.

My key fits on my door and another should not expect mine to fit on theirs.

> But enough of that.  You are here for the code, the code you shall receive!  I have a few repositories, of these few repositories there are three of which are being worked on simultaneously by me.  If you want to know what I have worked on in the past (personal projects), then you may want to check out the Software repository.  If instead you are out for nothing necessarily, then I would recommend checking out the DashFramework repository.  It contains all of the latest classes I use to build what I build.  It is basically (-as the name suggests) a framework of extension.
